# Architecture Documentation Sync

When developing new features or making architectural changes to the project, you MUST update the corresponding documentation and diagrams in the `docs/architecture/` directory to ensure they accurately reflect the current state of the system.

This includes:

- Updating `bevy_architecture_guide.md` for logic or structural changes.
- Updating Mermaid diagrams (`.mermaid` files) to reflect new components, systems, or state transitions.
- Ensuring the visual guides in `architecture_diagrams_guide.md` remain consistent with the implementation.
